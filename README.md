- 🔗 **RESTful API** for easy frontend integration
- 📝 **PGN export** for your games

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Stockfish binary (`stockfish.exe` in `stockfish/`)
- See [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) for Python dependencies

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/uselessbruh/chess-bot.git
cd chess-bot

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Ensure Stockfish binary is present
# (stockfish/stockfish.exe by default)
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Backend

## ⚠️ Limitations

> **:warning: This backend is NOT scalable for multiple users playing at the same time.**

- The backend uses a single global game instance, so all users share the same board and engine.
- For production or multi-user support, refactor to manage separate game sessions per user (using sessions, authentication, or unique game IDs).

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Troubleshooting

- If Stockfish is not found, ensure `stockfish.exe` is in the correct folder or update the path in `app.py`.
- Invalid moves return `{ "success": false, "error": "Invalid move" }`.
- Engine errors or missing dependencies will return a 500 error with a message.
- For CORS issues, ensure `flask-cors` is installed and enabled.

---

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

- Use any frontend (React, Vue, plain HTML/JS) to interact with the API.
- Example: Use [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) or [react-chessboard](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard) for the board UI.
- Send moves as UCI strings (e.g., `e2e4`) to the backend.

---

## 🏗️ Customization & Extending

- Add user authentication for multi-user support.
- Store games in a database for persistence.
- Add more endpoints (e.g., analysis, hints, puzzles).
- Deploy with Gunicorn + Nginx for production.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

For production:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 app:app
```

Use a process manager (e.g., Supervisor) and a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for best results.
